 ## [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/ssmith00/Computational-Physics/blob/master/Conway's%20Game%20of%20Life/ConwayGameofLife.py)
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
 
 A random 2d grid is generated, and then is set into simulation according to the rules in Conway's "Game of Life" (see link above).

 ## [Binary Stars](https://github.com/ssmith00/Computational-Physics/blob/master/BinaryStars.ipynb)
 Two stars with unequal masses in a binary system. Traced lines represent their orbit paths, black dot is the center of mass.
 ## [Lissajous Figures](https://github.com/ssmith00/Computational-Physics/blob/master/LissajousHW.ipynb)
 Two harmonic oscillators graphed in phase space with different starting parameters.
 ## [N-Body Simulation](https://github.com/ssmith00/Computational-Physics/blob/master/N-Body.ipynb)
 A numerical simulation of a complex, multi-body system. Blue dots represent the final position of the bodies and the black dot represents the center of mass.
 The system kinetic energy is plotted overtime, you can see the system stabilize as the number of time intervals goes to infinity.
 ## [Spacecraft Slingshot](https://github.com/ssmith00/Computational-Physics/blob/master/SpacecraftSlingShot.ipynb)
 A spacecraft launches from the surface of Earth (green dot), and then sling shots around two planets (Jupiter and the Venus) to escape the solar system.
 ## [Two-Body Simulation](https://github.com/ssmith00/Computational-Physics/blob/master/TwoBodySim.ipynb)
 An object is set in orbit around the sun.
